# Project Title

This project showcases two tasks that demonstrate the use of JavaScript 
and PHP to solve common programming challenges.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: JavaScript Button Toggle

In this task, we implemented a simple JavaScript functionality that 
allows buttons to work in sequence to show and hide text. This feature 
enhances user interaction by providing a dynamic way to control the 
visibility of content.

**Key Features:**
- Two buttons to toggle text visibility.
- Smooth transitions between showing and hiding the text.
- User-friendly interface for better interaction.

### Task 2: PHP Bracket Validation

The second task involves a PHP function that checks for correctly 
placed brackets in a given code snippet. This function helps in 
identifying syntax errors related to bracket placement, ensuring that 
the code adheres to proper structure.

**Key Features:**
- Validates the placement of curly brackets `{}` in PHP code.
- Outputs an error message if the brackets are mismatched.
- Easy integration into existing PHP applications for error checking.

## Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to interact with the 
  JavaScript toggle buttons.
- Test the PHP function by calling it with code snippets that have 
  mismatched brackets.
